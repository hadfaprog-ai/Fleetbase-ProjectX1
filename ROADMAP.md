# Roadmap — WIM Fleetbase

## Gate structure

Gates are sequential. Each gate has entry criteria (what must be true before starting), acceptance criteria (what proves it's done), and exit criteria (what must be true to call it complete).

---

### G0 — Foundation & Infrastructure Setup

**Entry:** Project charter signed off, LXC host identified, domain name secured

| Task | Dependencies | Est. effort |
|---|---|---|
| Create privileged LXC on Proxmox (nesting=1, 4C/6GB/24GB) | Host ready | 30 min |
| Install Docker CE on LXC (Debian repo) | LXC created | 15 min |
| Clone Fleetbase repo | Docker ready | 5 min |
| Run `scripts/docker-install.sh --non-interactive` | Repo cloned | ~15 min (first boot slow: image pulls + npm build + migrations) |
| Configure NPMplus reverse proxy for `fleetbase.wim.domain` | Stack running | 20 min |
| Patch HOST from localhost → LAN IP in compose override + console config | Stack running | 10 min |
| Verify console accessible via domain, API responds | Proxy configured | 5 min |

**Acceptance:** Fleetbase console loads at `https://fleetbase.wim.domain:4200`, API responds at `:8000`, socket connection works.
**Exit:** Infrastructure documented in ARCHITECTURE.md, credentials saved to vault.

### G1 — Core Data Setup (Stores, Products, Users)

**Entry:** Fleetbase stack running and accessible

| Task | Dependencies | Est. effort |
|---|---|---|
| Create Company record for WIM | G0 done | 5 min |
| Create WIM super admin user | Company created | 5 min |
| Import store data (Places) from current WIM data | Data export from KlikOrder/Groovi | 2-4 hrs |
| Create circular Zone geofences (10m) per store | Places imported | 1-2 hrs |
| Create Contact records (store owners) per store | Places imported | 1 hr |

| Create Vehicle records | Depots created | 30 min |

**Acceptance:** All WIM stores, products, users, drivers, and vehicles exist in Fleetbase. 10m geofences active per store. Admin can browse stores on the map.
**Exit:** Data import scripts saved in repository for repeatability.

### G2 — Route & Visit Workflow

**Entry:** G1 complete — stores, geofences, drivers, products in system

| Task | Dependencies | Est. effort |
|---|---|---|
| Create 4-week route schedule (20 route presets per depot) | G1 complete | 2-3 hrs |
| Assign routes to drivers | Routes created | 30 min |
| Verify geofence detection: POST /v1/drivers/{id}/track → GeofenceEntered | Geofences active | 1 hr |
| Build custom frontend (or configure Navigator) for sales rep check-in flow | API verified | 4-8 hrs |
| Implement selfie/photo attachment on tracking event | Check-in flow working | 2 hrs |
| Implement 3-minute minimum timer (frontend) | Check-in flow working | 1 hr |
| Implement no-order reason submission | Check-in flow working | 1 hr |
| Implement store stock tracking per SKU | Check-in flow working | 2 hrs |
| Implement visit gallery (photo + description) | Photo attachment working | 1 hr |

**Acceptance:** A sales rep can check in at a store (geofence triggers), take selfie, submit no-order with reason, or record store stock. Visit events logged with timestamps.
**Exit:** End-to-end visit flow documented and tested with a real phone.

### G3 — Order Management

**Entry:** G2 complete — visit workflow functional

| Task | Dependencies | Est. effort |
|---|---|---|
| Build product catalog browsing (brand filter, promo visibility) | G1 products, G2 visit flow | 3-4 hrs |
